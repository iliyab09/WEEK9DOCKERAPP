### Docker is a software platform for building applications based on containers—small and lightweight execution environments that make shared use of the operating system kernel but otherwise run in isolation from one another. While containers have been used in Linux and Unix systems for some time, Docker, an open source project launched in 2013, helped popularize the technology by making it easier than ever for developers to package their software to “build once and run anywhere.”</br></br></br>



In this project I will manage the code of the application using one of the most common and simple Git workflow usually called the “Feature Branch Workflow” in which branches named with the prefix “feature/” are used to work on the code independently and then the code is integrated into the master/main branch to be deployed in the target environments.
